There are various ways to perform write operations with Predator interfaces.

To insert data the simplest form is to define a method that accepts the type of the entity, the same way as the api:data.repository.CrudRepository[] interface does:

snippet::example.BookRepository[project-base="doc-examples/example", source="main", tags="save", indent="0"]

The method must accept a single argument that is the entity and start with either `save`, `persist`, `insert` or `store`.

Alternatively you can also define a method that features parameter names that match the properties of the entity name:

snippet::example.BookRepository[project-base="doc-examples/example", source="main", tags="save2", indent="0"]

In this case you must specify parameters for all properties other than those that are declared as `@Nullable` or as a `@GeneratedValue`, if you do not a compilation error will occur.
