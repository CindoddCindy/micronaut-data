Micronaut Data will automatically manage transactions for you. You can simply declare a method as transactional with the `javax.transaction.Transactional` annotation.

TIP: If you prefer Spring-managed transactions you can add a dependency on either `spring-orm` or `spring-jdbc` as well as `micronaut-spring` and Spring-managed transactions will be used instead.

Micronaut Data maps the declared transaction annotation to the correct underlying semantics and compilation time.

Micronaut Data will also automatically apply read-only transactional semantics to query methods and write transaction semantics to write operations.
