As seen in the <<jdbcQuickStart, Quick Start>> JDBC repositories in Predator are defined as interfaces that are annotated with the ann:data.jdbc.annotation.JdbcRepository[] annotation.

The ann:data.jdbc.annotation.JdbcRepository[] annotation accepts an optional string value which represents the name of the connection or datasource in a multiple datasource scenario. By default Predator will look for the default datasource.

The entity to treat as the root entity for the purposes of querying is established either from the method signature or from the generic type parameter specified to the api:data.repository.GenericRepository[] interface.

If no root entity can be established then a compilation error will occur.

The same interfaces supported by the JPA implementation are supported by JDBC.

Note that because queries are computed at compilation time the dialect you use must be specified on the repository. Possibly dialects are:

.Supported JDBC Dialects
[cols=2*]
|===
|*Dialect*
|*Description*

|api:data.model.query.builder.sql.Dialect#H2[]
|The H2 database (typically used for in-memory testing)

|api:data.model.query.builder.sql.Dialect#MYSQL[]
|MySQL 5.5 or above

|api:data.model.query.builder.sql.Dialect#POSTGRES[]
|Postgres 9.5 or above

|api:data.model.query.builder.sql.Dialect#SQL_SERVER[]
|SQL Server 2012 or above

|api:data.model.query.builder.sql.Dialect#ORACLE[]
|Oracle 12c or above

|===

TIP: It is recommended you test against your target dialect. The https://www.testcontainers.org[Test Containers] project is a great solution for this. If you must test against another dialect (like H2) then you can define a subinterface that `@Replaces` the repository with a different dialect for the scope of testing.

Note that in addition to interfaces you can also define repositories as abstract classes:

snippet::example.AbstractBookRepository[project-base="doc-examples/jdbc-example", source="main"]

As you can see from the above example, using abstract classes can be useful as it allows you to combine custom code that performs your own SQL queries.

The example above uses the api:data.jdbc.runtime.JdbcOperations[] interface which simplifies executing JDBC queries within the context of transactions.
